        A project I wanted to try was selling my collages on RedBubble. However, many of my collages had copyrighted photos that could not be published anywhere. For this personal project, I created a collage using open-source photos from photographers on Unsplash. This postcard is currently for sale on RedBubble, available as a poster, sticker, or notebook cover.
