        One of my favorite books of all time, <i>The Land of Love and Drowning</i>, by Tiphanie Yanique, has little to no fan-art made of it. I wanted to practice designing in the movie poster style using my favorite book as subject matter, so this project is an exploration of what it would look like if The Land of Love and Drowning were made into a movie.
