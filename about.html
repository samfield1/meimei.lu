                  <p>
                    I am Meimei Lu, an undergraduate pursuing a BFA in graphic
                    design at the George Washington University. I have designed
                    freelance work, and I have had my work exhibited at the Hirshhorn
                    Museum of Modern Art in Washington, DC.<br /><br />Graphic design
                    began for me when I was 12. I became part of a community of
                    teenagers on Instagram who ran accounts dedicated to their
                    favorite book, movie, or TV series, and created graphics about the
                    characters in those fictional worlds. From then onwards, designing
                    graphics about my beloved fictional worlds became the medium of
                    art I loved the most. <br /><br />When I am away from my laptop, I
                    am busy writing poems, playing video games, and trying to fill up
                    my sketchbook.
